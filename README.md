# Maze-Runner
The aim is to find the shortest path from source to the destination using searching algorithms - Depth First Search (DFS), Breadth First Search(BFS), A*(euclidean) and A*(manhattan).
After generating mazes for various dimensions, we implement DFS,BFS,A*(euclidean) and A*(manhattan) on each maze and find the average shortest path to reach the destination and analyse which algorithm outputs the most optimal path.
Different contraints are imposed on the maze generator function to compare the output for all the algorithms.It is explicitly described in the ipython notebook.
The Maze-Runner report has comparisions of each algorithm regarding its time complxities to find the path and the optimality of the path.
